Look at the [nitro quick start](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide#quick-start) to learn more how to get started.

## This exisit because it can exist and you should consider not using it.
 its how you can use ejs with "***filebase-routing***" with  ejs files. the goal is to get a minimum viable repo that you could use and make something ! the goal is to avoid client side  javascript and use server side javascript.

 TODO:
  - [ ] Add a way to add folder for layout??
  - [ ] add interactivity with  htmx?
  - [ ] make a server side use of the file-base routing with params
  - [ ] add a deployment strategy if there any???
